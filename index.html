              Mount Suswa is a shield volcano in the Great Rift Valley, Kenya.
              It is located between Narok and Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. The
              northwestern part of Mount Suswa is in Narok County, while the
              eastern and southern parts are in Kajiado County. The town with
              the same name, Suswa, is just northwest of the mountain and it is
              the main access point for visits to the mountain.

              km2 (2,300,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. This region

            <p>
              The Brazilian whiteknee tarantula (Acanthoscurria geniculata) is a
              species of tarantula from Brazil that is commonly kept as a
              pet.The body and legs of the Brazilian whiteknee tarantula are a
              deep brown color, often with some pink or orange hairs, though
              occasionally the legs may be slightly lighter in coloration. This
              contrasts the bright white bands on its legs, which are generally
              considered to be the main reason for its subjective beauty.

              Atlantic bushmaster, is a pit viper species found in South
              America, as well as the island of Trinidad in the Caribbean. Two
              subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate
              subspecies described here.Adults grow to an average of 2 to 2.5 m
              (6Â½-8 feet), although 3 m (10 feet) is not too unusual. The
              largest recorded specimen was 3.65 m (almost 12 feet) long, making
              the species the largest of all vipers and the longest venomous
              snake in the Western Hemisphere.

              the reticulated python. No subspecies are currently recognized.
              Like all boas, it is a non-venomous constrictor.

              The manchineel tree (Hippomane mancinella) is a species of
              flowering plant in the spurge family (Euphorbiaceae). Its native
              range stretches from tropical southern North America to northern
              South America. The name manchineel (sometimes spelled manchioneel
              or manchineal), as well as the specific epithet mancinella, are
              from Spanish manzanilla ('little apple'), from the superficial
              resemblance of its fruit and leaves to those of an apple tree. It
              is also called beach apple.

            area.[2][3] It is in the Daniel Campos Province in PotosÃ­ in
            southwest Bolivia, near the crest of the Andes at an elevation of
            3,656 m (11,995 ft) above sea level.[4] The Salar was formed as a
            result of transformations between several prehistoric lakes that
            existed around forty thousand years ago but had all evaporated over
            time.[2] It is now covered by a few meters of salt crust, which has
            an extraordinary flatness with the average elevation variations
            within one meter over the entire area of the Salar.
